# Writeboard #
##### A whiteboard for distributed teams #####
Check it out: http://writeboard.nodester.com

Features
--------
The only, yet main, feature are the rooms.
When you access the Writeboard via http://writeboard.nodester.com you'll be redirected to a new room with a random identifier. But, if you want your rooms to have an easy name to remember, you can go straight to http://writeboard.nodester.com/gtramontina for example.

Tips
----
-   Use it fullscreen. Usually F11 makes your browser fullscreen.
-   You can project your browser in fullscreen to a wall and simulate a mouse with [Wiimote Whiteboard](http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/) and an IR pen.
-   Create your own room by accessing writeboard.nodester.com/your_fancy_room_name

Roadmap
-------
-   Keep drawings in the room so that new attendees can see what's been drawn so far. (DONE: improvement required though)
-   Make password-protected private rooms, so you can have a safe meeting.
-   Add 'Save as... PNG/JPEG' option, for emailing the board to the attendees.
